        First Fiddle Restaurants, formerly known as The Lazeez Affaire
        Group, was conceived in the year 1999 by Priyank Sukhija and Y.P.
        Ashok. Since then, the company has made a name for itself as
        innovators and leaders in the industry. Starting with their first
        brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised the conceptof fine dining
        at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its success, First
        Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with brands such as
        Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of The Drinks, Flying Saucer Cafe, and
        more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new brand, First Fiddle
        brought a concept that was never experienced or heard of before,
        such as Plum by Bent Chair, Miso Sexy, Diablo, and more. The
        restaurants are spread all over India in major metropolitan cities
        like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and more, with plans to expand
        internationally soon.

        With over 30 restaurants in 23 years under his belt, the prolific
        restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has become somewhat of a legend in the
        industry, starting his journey at a mere age of 19. Priyank was the
        first in his family to venture into business, hailing from a family
        of lawyers, going on to create an empire in F&B. Following his heart
        and tongue through his F&B career, Priyank has successfully created
        some of the most talked-about brands in the industry - Diablo, Lord
        of the Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Lazeez Affaire, Tamasha, The
        Flying Saucer Cafe, and many more.
